# RTT-Measurement-FABRIC
Measuring RTT using different methods on FABRIC and comparing them.

Paper Abstract - This paper presents a comprehensive study of Round-Trip Time (RTT) within the intricate framework of the FABRIC testbed network. RTT, a fundamental metric of network performance, serves as a crucial determinant of user experience and the overall quality of a network. This study explores the facets of RTT, delving into its impact on user satisfaction and network efficiency. To achieve these objectives, various RTT measurement methods are compared and employed. These methods include One-way Latency (OWL) utilizing Precision Time Protocol (PTP), a novel algorithm implemented in the data-plane using P4 programmable high-performance BMv2 switches, continuous TCP traffic analysis, and the traditional UNIX "ping" command. By leveraging these diverse techniques, this study provides a nuanced understanding of RTT measurement behaviors.

The files and code are unorganized as of now. I will sort them out as soon as I can.
